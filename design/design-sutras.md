# The Design Sutras of Bivee
###### With apologies to [Vasagupta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva_Sutras_of_Vasugupta)

## 1. Be brave, not perfect.

Be willing to let the work take you somewhere, and have the courage to follow it all the way there.

## 2. Start messy. Clean it up little by little.

Try stuff out. Eyeball things. Cut before you  measure. Knock all your ideas together.

Now put it down for awhile.

When you come back, start looking for connections and relationships. Start consolidating ideas and working out rules for the relationships you've established. Find ways to simplify. Get it a little cleaner.

Repeat.

## 3. Get the design to a place you really like. Then break it.

Don't get trapped by what you see right now. You've spent 20 hours getting that headline to feel just right over the photo. It’s looking really good.

But sometimes a really great idea is hiding right behind the one you have now. To find it, you have to be willing to push aside your current idea.

Take a deep breath, save/commit a version, then break it. Do something unthinkable to it. Make that headline absurdly huge. Now make it really tiny. Make the R pink. Add a different photo.

The new idea is hidden under the current one. Keep moving things around until you can see it underneath. It'll be worth it.

## 4. Fork your teammates.

As they say, an idea is what happens when you look at one thing but see something else. We move forward by building on what we  have. Nobody owns the design, there's no turf to protect. "Originality" is often just an idea that needs more iteration. Instead, think of the design as a big conversation: statements & replies, each leading the other to new places.

Take your teammates' work and build on it: improve it, evolve it, bend it to your own purposes. Fork and iterate.

But always....

## 5. Give credit, don't take it.

We design in the open. Everyone can watch the design evolve, everyone can contribute if they have an idea. The design doesn't belong to anybody. It's a long climb produced by countless small steps.

And it only works with mutual respect, and generosity. Never miss a chance to give props to your teammates. Better yet, do it publicly. Credit is like a [trail name](http://www.appalachiantrail.org/about-the-trail): it must be earned, not claimed, and given by a fellow hiker.

## 6. Before you criticize somebody's work, borrow their glasses.

Really hate what your teammate just showed you? Great! You now have what we call "cold" feedback.

Cold feedback is your immediate reaction to work you've never seen before and know nothing about - what you're seeing "cold." This is often the kind of feedback we get from clients and viewers, and it's really important.

However, cold feedback is limited by its nature. You can only say so much about something you don't know. And **there are good ideas in every failure**. As a design shop, our goal is to harvest good ideas anywhere we can find them: success, failure, wherever.

So how do you get to those ideas hidden in a comp you just don't get? Through _empathic_ feedback.

You have your cold feedback. Remember your first reaction, but file it away for a little while. Now, start asking questions. Try to see where the designer is coming from and where they're trying to go. How did they frame the problem? How do they see the solution? You need to understand their point of view and their goals. Try to see the work the way they see it, through their glasses.

Once you have a better handle on that, go back to your cold reaction. How does your own "outside" perception of the work differ from the designer's "inside" perceptions (or assumptions or hypotheses)? Try to get to the root of that disconnect, and find a path for the designer to meet their own goals.

As a designer, the more you can frame your feedback with empathy, the more opportunities you'll find to free ideas from a specific execution, and to help other designers grow on their _own terms_, not yours.

## 7. Design requires emotional intelligence, not just problem solving.

An engineer solves problems. A designer uses the engineer's solution to make people _feel_ something. That "something" doesn't have to be "pleasant" or "satisfied" or any of those other words you see on a customer survey. Sometimes a great design hits you in the stomach. Sometimes it makes you question things you'd rather not. In these cases, it's successful because the design created a connection – a relationship, a conversation – between poeple.

Your prototype might have all the right fonts, perfect kerning, and a color scheme in the Kuler hall of fame. But if it doesn't make people feel something when they use it, you're not done. Giving your work a bit of soul is the hardest thing to learn to do, the hardest to explain, and also what will make it worth doing in the end. Never forget that what you're making will be used by a human just like you. Otherwise, the robots win.

## 8. Try to avoid imposing [minimalist Bauhaus-esque fascist snoozefests](http://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/im-comic-sans-asshole) all the time.

It's rude to be fascist.
