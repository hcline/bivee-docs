# Our design process

The goal of finishing a project as beautifully, efficiently, and smoothly as it can possibly be done is a moving target. Best practices are always evolving. New ideas are growing as rapidly as blog posts can be published. Consequently, our industry is filled with so many buzzwords it can hard to hear yourself think. It's a bit ironic that an industry known for constant, rapid change can also be rather dogmatic. Agencies and bloggers can get partisan about their favorite tools, approaches, and frameworks, defending them far more bitterly than their shelf life might seem to warrant.

Bivee's feeling about all this is that while tools and ideas come and go, our relationship with our clients and customers persists. Tn the end, the client usually doesn't care about whether you used SCRUM management or SASS 3.3 or Atomic Design or whatever -- they just want a beautiful system that works. Our job is to help them achieve it, but also to communicate that process clearly and simply, _in their language, not ours_. All our techniques and tricks can stay behind the magician's curtain.

So, following is the basic process we use for most projects. It'll probably change by this time tomorrow. But that's because it's just a guide to help us -- not a cage to trap ourselves or the client in. Rule #1 in Bivee project management is _no buzzwords_. Listen, don't preach.

## Setting up the bowling pins
##### IA and content strategy

// stuff here about solving the IA problems first and using those to define the design requirements
// core model, sitemaps, sketching on paper, wireframes

## What's out there?
##### Comparative analysis

// find examples and arrange them along spectrums according to mood, color, imagery, etc. and take the client's temperature on each

## Choosing a necktie
##### Building styles and look-and-feel

// style tiles, element collages, font combinations, palettes

## Building from the inside out
##### Mockups and sketches

// based on core model and sketches, begin building mockups of core pages and discuss with client

## Prototyping
##### Click-through, in-browser design work

// build in-browser (invision, framer, and/or HTML) prototypes to work out the experience in a context as close to native as possible

## Fill the toobox
##### Build a styleguide/component library

// using Atomic Design/modular ideas -- atoms combine into molecules combine into organisms etc.

## Make friends with the coders
##### Collaborate with developers during build phases

// dev and designer stay in close touch and continue to brainstorm on new features and flows as needed
