# Beginning HMTL & CSS

Here are some resources for learning basic web coding (HTML & CSS). Everybody learns best in different ways (some like reading books, others like to use interactive tutorials and forums, etc.), so here’s a range of good stuff to try out.

In general, it’s helpful to have a ‘real’ project to work on while you’re learning (it gives you a place to immediately apply what you’re learning, and solve real problems), so we suggest you try making a basic website for either yourself or a friend. All you need to get started is a text editor (I suggest Sublime Text (http://www.sublimetext.com), which you can download for free) and a browser (Chrome, Firefox and Safari are all good browsers to develop in).

## General

### Books

#### The Visual QuickStart Guide to HTML & CSS
http://www.peachpit.com/store/html-and-css-visual-quickstart-guide-9780321928832

This book is a classic and we're big fans of Elizabeth Castro’s writing. They have a simple 1-page, 1-concept format, so you can kind of leave the book open in your lap and use it a reference.

#### HTML & CSS: Design & Build Websites

This looks really nice; we like how it uses a lot of visuals.

#### CSS: The Definitive Guide
http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596527334.do

O’Reilly is a favorite publisher, and they’re almost always excellent. This book is by Eric Meyer, one of the leading experts on CSS since it’s earliest days. This book is more advanced in some places, so we’d suggest this alongside a more beginner-oriented HTML/CSS guide.

### Online

#### Code Academy, Code School, Treehouse
These web-based tutorials are all pretty excellent and a great way to pick up the basics if you’re more of an ‘active’ learner (i.e. doing stuff instead of just reading). Accounts are usually pretty affordable. They also usually offer a wide range of topics and are often more up to date than books are.

#### [A List Apart](http://alistapart.com)

This is a trade magazine site dedicated to standards-based web design & development. Sometimes it can be a little arcane for beginners, but for the most part it’s the best forum out there for new ideas and best practices.

#### [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com)

A giant blog/cookbook/tutorial/encyclopedia of CSS tips and discussion. You can google pretty much any CSS problem and chances are a CSS Tricks post will be at the top of your results — for good reason.

#### [Zeldman presents](http://www.zeldman.com)

Jeffrey Zeldman is the godfather of standards-based web design and his wisdom is legend. Also he’s an entertaining blogger and podcaster.

#### [Lea Verou’s blog](http://lea.verou.me)

Lea Verou is a CSS ninja par none with a scarily powerful brain. I am grateful that she decided on code for her vocation instead of, say, military conquest. She discusses mostly very advanced stuff on her blog, and she can be hard for beginners to follow, but her site is a great place to see just how far you can take CSS.

#### [For the hardcore: View source

Finally, the coolest thing about the web is that it is almost entirely open-source. That is, you can go to any web page in your browser, select “View source” (or “view page source”, depending on your browser), and you can look through all the code that page uses. Some sites are messy and some deliberately obfuscate their code (which is annoying), but nonetheless, you can learn an awful lot just by getting into the habit of checking out the source code of web sites you really like. You’ll see some really great ideas and also lots of really, really terrible practices, but all of it is stuff people are actually using in real projects, which is terrific insight.
