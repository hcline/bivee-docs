# Welcome to Bivee!

When bringing on a new person, there are certain things we need to do to get you up and running! 

First things first, we need to sign a contract! Here are two versions – depending on what we will be doing together, you will either be:

1. An Independent Contractor (link)
2. An Employee (link)

Once we have all of the legal components sorted, you will then get an invite to your *personal* email address to sign up with our payroll service – Gusto. We will collect all of the other necessary filing requirements and banking details from you at that point so we can pay you.

Now, we'll work with you to get you acquainted with our team and culture, and the various platforms we use day-to-day.

## Team Integration

1. Home office setup and help, if needed: separate, controlled workspace; scheduling and routine; working independently (with little oversight); managing your bandwidth and time.
2. Intro to company culture: we're a small/startup environment where everybody wears a lot of hats, and you might be doing lots of different kinds of work from one day to the next.
3. Research, internal development, side projects: we bring in people who love to learn and we try to give them lots of room to try out new ideas. Part of your job is research: finding better ways to solve problems, finding new aproaches and angles. Find something great or have a new idea? Share it with the team and let's see how we can make it happen. Part of the reason we work together is for the exchange of ideas, building on one another's inspiration.
4. Initiation: ceremonial new person sushi dinner. (or whatever, if you're a veggiesaur or seafoodphobe)

## System Set up

1. Set up an email at http://www.google.com/a/bivee.co. Your email will be your login for most of our accounts & tools. (Email names are set up using their first names followed by the domain name i.e. `jane@bivee.co`. In the event that two people have the same first name, the first letter of their last name will be added i.e. `janed@bivee.co`. Let's hope we dont have to get more complicated than that for now...)
2. Set up accounts on [Asana](http://asana.com), [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com), [Github](https://github.com/biveeco), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/bivee/), [Harvest](https://bivee.harvestapp.com/people), [Slack](https://bivee.slack.com/), and [Zoom](https://zoom.us). Email, calendars, and docs are created automatically courtesy of the Google Apps account under your email.
3. Set up a computer (ideally of the Macintosh persuasion) with dotfiles and basic installs (Node, Ruby, Git, Vagrant, XCode, etc.) using Bivee's [setup instructions](https://github.com/biveeco/laptop-setup).


## Communication channels & tools

As a company of mainly remote workers, we use a variety of communication tools & platforms to manage our workflow, stay in touch, and provide support. Our tools basically work on a scale from "most immediate" to "most permanent." The "most immediate" tools are the quickest but also the most temporary in terms of saving content. The "most permanent" tools require more setup (ie, provision a repository or format a document) but they can be saved forever and easily referenced later. Here's the major ones with their best uses:

- **Zoom**: discuss things right now. Great for: meetings, remote coworking, pair programming.
- **Slack**: things you need to share or show to someone, but don't need to save. Great for: questions, random thoughts, meeting agendas, code troubleshooting, pictures of dogs with funny haircuts.
- **Asana**: assign and discuss a specific task/deliverable that you can refer back to later. Great for: tasking, providing/recording feedback, sharing mockups, status updates.
- **Google Docs**: work together on longform/more complex stuff that you need to store (semi) permanently. Can easily be referenced/shared on any other channel. Great for: meeting notes, draft proposals, budgets, brainstorming.
- **Dropbox/Github/Bitbucket**: share project files, code, and assets which need to be version-controlled. Can easily be referenced/shared on any other channel. Great for: workfiles, common assets, code, permanent documents.

One outlier:

- **Email**: don't use email unless you have to. Anything you write in an email should ideally be recorded in one of the other channels, so it doesn't get lost in the email archive abyss. Great for: talking to clients.
